In this project we scrape Wikipedia pages to create a dataset on DC Comics movies.

We cover a wide range of Python & data science topics in this project. They include:

Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Cleaning data
- Testing code with Pytest
- Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
- Working with dates (datetime library)
- Saving & loading data with Pickle library
